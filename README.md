# tiny-neuron
Rust open source neural network implementation solely built using the standard library.

## Preface

This project is a spinoff of Biome1, a c++ project having to do with small creatures in a small world. The project was deemed a sucess by myself, but the technical debt was far too high. So, this project is a sub-project that will handle the neuron logic behind our small creatures. The project is made as a standalone crate intended for reuse.
